#CatLynx

##Desciption

CatLynx is a web app that connects classmates in order to collaborate, get help, and share insights.
We've all been in a class where we don't know anyone. 
CatLynx is here to make sure that even the most shy and quiet student can find help.
Since CatLynx uses UVM authentication, only current UVM students can sign in.
No professors, which means no pressure and no impact on your grades!

##Background

CatLynx was developed in under 12 hours at a Hackathon sponsored by State Street at the University of Vermont by a team of 8 undergraduate computer science students.
The team members were:

* Aaron Brunet
* Anna Margolis
* Dillon Beliveau
* Joey Anetsberger
* Lily Nguyen
* Paul Kiripolsky
* Simon Anguish
* Will Barnwell

All team members gained valuable experience with the strategy of Agile software development, and also pooled their shared experience with various tools, including:

####Vagrant
A tool for quickly and automatically setting up identical development environments, eliminating the headaches of team members using different operating systems, and also disqualifying "works on my machine" as a valid excuse.

####Django
"The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines." A Python web framework designed to remove much of the repetitive work from web development. Using Django allowed us to quickly develop this application without having to worry as much about security, database access, user authentication, and more. Django is self contained, includes all tools necessary for a model view controller framework (ORM, templating, routing, as well as a large library of shortcut functions) with excellent documentation all in once place.

####SASS
SASS is a CSS preprocessor that allows a designer to stay organized while writing large quantities of CSS. Even for a small 12 hour project such as CatLynx, SASS allowed our team to keep track of all our stylesheets and save significant time.
